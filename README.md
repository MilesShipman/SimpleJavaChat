The was the final iteration for a project in my Junior Seminars Class for Computer Science. The project consist of 
a basic server and a basic chat qui that allows the user to communicate with other users in the chat room at the same
time or send private messages by using @-username- -then message here-.   There are other commands such as /help, /quit, 
/who, /who OP, along with a hidden /kick -username- and /kickall.  

There are a few things that I would have liked to implimented but never got the chance such as creating a username and
password that would be saved serverside so that the user just logs on and it know is that user is op or not.  These minor
changes might later be implemented but as of now the project stands as is.   

To use run the server which will provide you with the IP address that the users will need to add into the GUI of the chat 
Client so that they can connect to the server. Then follow the directions and the user is good to go. 

I know that the server works with up to 23 people on it, with about 30 messages a second.  I know I can optimize it more, 
but considering this was a project with a two week time line, I think that the final product was good.
